# View Pager

## Introduction
The viewpager is the widget that helps us or allows the user to swipe right or left to see an entirely new screen. In other way, we can say that it is a great way to show the user multiple tabs. It has also the capability to strongly remove or add pages (tabs) anytime. We can think of an idea of grouping search results by certain classes, and showing each class in a separate list. With the use of viewpager, the user could swipe right or left to see the other categories lists or classes. For using the viewpager, it need some knowledge of both the Fragments and PageAdapters. In this case, the Fragments are the "pages". On each screen that the ViewPager let the user to scroll is a Fragment. With the use of Fragments instead of a view, there is much broad range of chances to show in each page. Then there is no limit to just list of items. There can be  any collections of views and widgets that we may need. We can believe of PageAdapters in the similar way of ListAdapters. The task of PageAdapters is to provide Fragments(instead of views) to the UI for drawing.
